    <h2>Story and Setting</h2>
    <p>
      "Sonic CD" follows the adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog as he strives to
      thwart the evil plans of his nemesis, Dr. Robotnik (Dr. Eggman). Dr.
      Robotnik has discovered the mystical Little Planet, a celestial body that
      appears over Never Lake once a year. Harnessing the power of the Time
      Stones, Robotnik plans to manipulate time and take over the world. Sonic
      must traverse through time, visiting past, present, and future versions of
      the game's levels to stop Robotnik and save Little Planet.
    </p>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
      The core gameplay of "Sonic CD" remains true to the classic Sonic formula:
      fast-paced platforming action, intricate level designs, and a focus on
      speed and agility. However, "Sonic CD" introduces a unique time travel
      mechanic, allowing players to navigate through different versions of each
      stage. <br />Super Peelout: This move allows Sonic to go at high speeds.
      When performed sonic leans forwards with his arms back and goes off.
      <br />
      Time Travel: By hitting signposts labeled "Past" or "Future" and
      maintaining high speed, Sonic can travel through time. Each time period
      (past, present, future) has distinct environmental changes and enemy
      placements.<br />
      Time Stones: Collecting all seven Time Stones can alter the future,
      turning it from a dystopian world dominated by Robotnik to a utopian one
      free from his control. <br />Special Stages: Players can enter 3D special
      stages to collect the Time Stones, featuring a mode-7 style pseudo-3D
      environment where Sonic must destroy UFOs within a time limit.
